Here I list most of my independent projects.

## Hey, thanks for the fish!

Back in 2015, I enjoyed a software competition at the University of Kiel.
We needed to build an artificial intelligence that plays the board game *Hey, thanks for the fish!* against others.
Our bot called *Breadfish* turned out to be very successful and we managed to win the finals against 400 competitors.

As you can see in the [project repository](https://github.com/jvpichowski/cau-software-challenge-2015-submission) we were using a highly optimized iterative deepening alpha-beta search with a unique feature set.

After five years of absence, it is time to revive the project with an artificial intelligence-based on new concepts.
Back in the days, we named our ai Breadfish after the song about [the marvellous breadfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RpdPzJgaBw). 
Now it is time to go to the next step and build the [Marvellous Breadfish AI](https://github.com/jvpichowski/marvellous-breadfish-ai).
Stay tuned for a new attempt on fishing on ice floes.

Of course, I need to rebuild the [game server](https://github.com/jvpichowski/hey-thanks-for-the-fish) because the competition servers went offline a long time ago.

## Rocket Sound

During studies I work with model rockets. 
At some point we asked ourselves whether it is possible to estimate the state of a rocket by measuring sound.

## There is always more

I still need to prepare some of my old treasures.
