### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jan, a computer science master's student from WÃ¼rzburg Germany.

My sweet spot is embedded development with a focus on space-related control software and computer vision.
During my studies, I got the opportunity to work on three [REXUS/BEXUS](http://rexusbexus.net/) projects.
We built an autonomous vision system on a high-altitude balloon and a novel recovery system, called [Daedalus](https://wuespace.de/daedalus/), which is dropped from sounding rockets.
This is an amazing journey and I like to present our open source ground station [Telestion](https://github.com/TelestionTeam) to you, which powers these projects.

If you are lucky you will probably catch me fiddling with my passion: computer game projects.
To put some more effort into this hobby I started a double degree in games engineering. 
After half a year of work, I proudly present our first game prototype [Back in Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irkcqxGfY24&list=PLthd3ST3SckSovN5qMWRHe4go_FHJtczU&index=12).

Besides those activities, I like to attend competitions and hackathons.
I spend some time in internships and working in research groups at my university and CLAAS Gmbh.

Just drop me a mail if you are interested in [my projects](https://github.com/jvpichowski-projects) or like to work together with me on new ideas.
